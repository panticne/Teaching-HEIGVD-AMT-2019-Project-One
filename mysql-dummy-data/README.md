# mysql-dummy-data

A small utility command line script to generate dummy data for MySQL tables. This script works with relational tables (one-to-many, many-to-many)
and with most popular data types. This is a work in progress, and may not work properly.

### Usage

First export a .sql dump using either mysqldump or phpmyadmin. Make sure all the tables are empty, otherwise this script may fail to work correctly.
For mysqldump, execute this command: `mysqldump -u <username> -p <DATABASE_NAME> > <dump.sql>`
For phpmyadmin, go the export tab and export with no options.

`python main.py <your_dump_file> [<options>]`

The generated file will be in the current working directory. Now import this file into an empty database of your choosing.

### Options

`--rows <number_of_rows>` - Specify the number of rows to be generated. Note: Avoid generating more than 50,000 rows, as the sql file may be unable to be imported. Default is 10.

`--phpmyadmin` - Use this argument when using a .sql dump generated by phpmyadmin.

`--output <output_file_name>` - Specify the desired output file name. Default is output.sql.

###### Currently supported data types:
>TINYINT, SMALLINT, INT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT
>DECIMAL, FLOAT, DOUBLE, REAL
>CHAR, VARCHAR, TINYTEXT, TEXT, MEDIUMTEXT, LONGTEXT
>DATE, YEAR, TIMESTAMP, DATETIME, TIME

This is a work in progress and may not work for some databases.
